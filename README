 Bank Customer Management System

 1. Introduction

The Bank Customer Management System is a simple, menu-driven command line application developed using Core Java, JDBC, and MySQL. It is designed to manage bank customer records efficiently while demonstrating the use of layered architecture in Java applications.

 2. Objectives

* To understand Core Java and JDBC connectivity
* To implement CRUD operations using MySQL
* To follow layered architecture (DTO, DAO, Service, Main)
* To build a simple menu-driven banking application

3. Scope of the Project

This project focuses only on managing customer-related information in a bank. It allows adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting customer records. Advanced banking features like transactions and accounts are not included.

 4. Technology Stack

* Programming Language: Java (Core Java)
* Database: MySQL
* Connectivity: JDBC
* IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans
* Server: MySQL Server

 5. System Requirements

 Hardware Requirements

* Processor: Intel i3 or above
* RAM: Minimum 4 GB
* Hard Disk: 10 GB free space

Software Requirements

* JDK 8 or above
* MySQL Server
* MySQL Connector/J
* Any Java IDE

 6. Database Design

 Database Name

bank_db

Table: customers

| Column Name | Data Type                | Description            |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| id          | INT (PK, AUTO_INCREMENT) | Customer ID            |
| name        | VARCHAR(100)             | Customer Name          |
| email       | VARCHAR(100)             | Customer Email         |
| mobile      | VARCHAR(15)              | Customer Mobile Number |
| city        | VARCHAR(50)              | Customer City          |

 7. Project Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture to separate responsibilities and improve maintainability.

 7.1 DTO Layer (Customer.java)

The DTO layer represents the customer entity. It contains private variables, constructors, getters, and setters to transfer customer data between layers.

 7.2 DAO Layer (CustomerDAO.java)

The DAO layer handles all database-related operations such as inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting customer records using JDBC and SQL queries.

 7.3 Service Layer (CustomerService.java)

The Service layer contains business logic and interacts with the DAO layer. It handles user input, processes data, and displays results to the user.

 7.4 Utility Layer (DBConnection.java)

This class is responsible for establishing a connection between the Java application and the MySQL database using JDBC.

 7.5 Main Layer (CustomerApp.java)

The Main class provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system and invoke service-layer methods.

 8. Functional Features

* Add new customer
* View all customers
* Search customer by ID
* Update customer mobile number
* Delete customer record
* View total customer count
* View customers by city

 9. Sample Menu

1. Add Customer
2. View Customers
3. Search Customer by ID
4. Update Customer Mobile
5. Delete Customer
6. Customer Count
7. View Customers by City
8. Exit

 10. Advantages

* Simple and easy to use
* Clear separation of layers
* Reduces code redundancy
* Easy to maintain and extend

 11. Limitations

* No authentication or authorization
* No transaction or account management
* Command-line interface only

 12. Future Enhancements

* Add account and transaction modules
* Implement user authentication
* Convert application to GUI or web-based
* Add validation and exception handling

 13. Conclusion

The Bank Customer Management System successfully demonstrates the use of Core Java, JDBC, and MySQL to build a layered, menu-driven application. It serves as a strong foundation for understanding database-driven Java applications.
